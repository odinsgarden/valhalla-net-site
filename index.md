**Security through physical isolation — not endless patching.**

**Valhalla Ghost Layer**  
Diode-isolated, RAM-only, PQC-anchored compute environment that eliminates persistent identity, resists forensic analysis, and enables secure autonomy in contested environments.

This is the secondary landing page for valhallainnovations.net — optimized for dedicated content on security, simplicity, and isolation.  
The architecture mirrors the primary site for performance consistency:
- **Layout**: default ensures Hyde/Beautiful Jekyll styling applies cleanly  
- **_config.yml**: optimized for zero-latency asset loading  

**Core Philosophy**  
Modern systems aren’t broken — they’re just too big to defend.  
Reduce what can be touched. Isolate what can’t be.  
Simplicity scales — complexity kills.
