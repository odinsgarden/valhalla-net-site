# Valhalla Innovations

**Security through physical isolation — not endless patching.**

## Valhalla Ghost Layer

Diode-isolated, RAM-only, PQC-anchored compute environment that eliminates persistent identity, resists forensic analysis, and enables secure autonomy in contested environments.

This is the secondary landing page for **valhallainnovations.net** — optimized for dedicated content on security, simplicity, and isolation. The architecture mirrors the primary site for performance consistency.

- **Layout**: `default` ensures Hyde/Beautiful Jekyll styling applies cleanly  
- **_config.yml**: optimized for zero-latency asset loading

## Core Philosophy

Modern systems aren’t broken — they’re just too big to defend.  
Reduce what can be touched. Isolate what can’t be.  
**Simplicity scales — complexity kills.**
